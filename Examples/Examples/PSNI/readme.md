# Persistent Stochastic Non-Interference

In this page we placed some examples of PSNI testing in the PEPA Eclipse Plug-in. 
A process compliancy to PSNI is verified by clicking on 'PEPA' in the top bar, 'Markovian Analysis' and then 'Verify PSNI...'. 

We provide the PEPA sources files to replicate the fair/unfair miner example we presented in the paper 'Enhancing the PEPA Eclipse Plug-in'.
